std::string str = "world, hello!";
std::size_t pos = str.find("hello");
if (pos != std::string::npos) {
    std::cout << "Substring found at position " << pos << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "Substring not found." << std::endl;
}


If the substring "hello" is found in the string, the find() function will return the index of the first
character of the substring in the string (in this case, pos will be equal to 7). If the substring is not
found, the function will return string::npos, which is a special value indicating that the substring was 
not found in the string. In this case, the code will output "Substring not found.".






string::npos is a constant static member of the std::string class in C++. It represents the largest
possible value for a size_t variable, which is a type used for storing the size of objects in memory.

In the find() function of a std::string, the function returns the position of the first occurrence
of a specified substring within the string, or string::npos if the substring is not found.

For example, if we have a string str and we want to find the position of the
substring "hello" within it, we can use the find() function as follows:
